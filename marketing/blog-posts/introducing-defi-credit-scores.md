# Introducing DeFi Credit Scores: A New Era of Crypto Lending

DeFi lending has revolutionized finance, but it comes with a significant drawback: over-collateralization. Today, we're introducing CreditFi, a groundbreaking protocol that brings credit scores to DeFi, making lending more accessible and efficient than ever before.

## The Problem with Traditional DeFi Lending

In traditional DeFi lending, borrowers must provide collateral exceeding their loan value, typically 150% or more. This means to borrow $1,000, you need to lock up at least $1,500 in collateral. This system:
- Locks up excessive capital
- Excludes many potential borrowers
- Ignores borrower creditworthiness
- Limits DeFi adoption

## Enter CreditFi: DeFi Credit Scores

CreditFi introduces the first comprehensive on-chain credit scoring system, ranging from 0 to 850. Your score is calculated based on:

### 1. Repayment History (40%)
- Timely loan repayments
- Early repayment bonuses
- Default history

### 2. Wallet Health (20%)
- Balance stability
- Transaction patterns
- Asset diversity

### 3. Collateral Management (15%)
- Liquidation history
- Collateral ratios maintained
- Risk management behavior

### 4. DeFi Activity (25%)
- Protocol interactions
- Transaction volume
- Account age
- Cross-chain presence
