# CreditFi Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is CreditFi?
CreditFi is a DeFi lending protocol that introduces credit scores to crypto lending, allowing borrowers to access better terms based on their on-chain credit history.

### How does CreditFi work?
CreditFi analyzes your DeFi activity to generate a credit score (0-850), which determines your borrowing terms. Better scores mean lower collateral requirements and better interest rates.

### Is CreditFi audited?
Yes, our smart contracts have undergone security audits, and we maintain an active bug bounty program. View our security documentation at [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md).

## Credit Scores

### How is my credit score calculated?
Your score is based on:
- 40% Repayment history
- 20% Wallet health
- 15% Collateral management
- 25% DeFi activity

### How can I improve my credit score?
- Make timely loan repayments
- Maintain healthy collateral ratios
- Keep consistent wallet activity
- Avoid liquidations
- Use multiple DeFi protocols responsibly

### How often is my credit score updated?
Credit scores are updated in real-time as you interact with the protocol and other DeFi platforms.
