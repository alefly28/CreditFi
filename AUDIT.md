# CreditFi Security Audit Preparation

## Project Overview

CreditFi is a DeFi lending platform that introduces credit scores to crypto lending. The platform enables users to:
- Build credit scores based on their DeFi activity
- Borrow assets using their credit score
- Lend assets to earn interest
- Participate in governance

## Key Components

### Smart Contracts

1. **CreditScore.sol**
   - Credit score calculation (0-850 range)
   - Factors: repayment history, wallet balance, collateral management, etc.
   - Access control for score updates
   - Emergency pause functionality

2. **LendingPool.sol**
   - Lending and borrowing functionality
   - Collateral management
   - Interest rate calculation
   - Flash loan protection
   - Liquidation mechanism

3. **LendingGovernance.sol**
   - Platform governance
   - Parameter updates
   - Emergency controls

4. **TestnetFaucet.sol**
   - Testnet token distribution
   - Rate limiting
   - Whitelist management

## Critical Functionality

### Credit Score Calculation
```solidity
function calculateCreditScore(address user) public view returns (uint256) {
    ScoreData storage data = userScores[user];
    // ... calculation logic
}
```

### Lending Operations
```solidity
function borrow(uint256 amount) external payable
function repayLoan() external payable
function liquidate(address borrower) external
```

### Flash Loan Protection
```solidity
mapping(address => uint256) public lastBorrowBlock;
require(lastBorrowBlock[msg.sender] != block.number, "No same-block borrowing");
```

## Areas of Concern

1. **Credit Score Manipulation**
   - Score calculation accuracy
   - Data manipulation resistance
   - Access control effectiveness

2. **Lending Security**
   - Collateral management
   - Interest calculations
   - Liquidation fairness
   - Flash loan protection

3. **Governance**
   - Parameter update safety
   - Access control
   - Emergency procedures

4. **Economic Security**
   - Interest rate model
   - Liquidation incentives
   - Flash loan resistance

## Test Coverage

Current test coverage:
- Unit tests: ~85%
- Integration tests: ~70%
- Governance tests: ~75%

## Known Issues

1. Front-running possibilities in liquidation
2. Gas optimization needed in credit score updates
3. Potential timestamp manipulation in interest calculation
